# TODO

1. make it mitm compatiable


# QA
**Why still can't I download m3u8 even though I got the correct m3u8 content?**

Sometimes m3u8 file is not enough for m3_dl to donwload, cause the key is protected by user credential or whatever. 

You need to get the key somehow. and tell m3_dl by -e option.
